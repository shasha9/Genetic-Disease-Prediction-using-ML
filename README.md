# Genetic Disease Prediction using ML
Genetic diseases have significantly increased nowadays and it is very important to treat them at an early stage.This project aims to address the problem of early prediction of genetic diseases which are difficult to predict by normal methods.

In this project a machine learning mode is developed that can identify genetic diseases/disorders, categorizing diseases based on psychiatric disorders by using the Random Forest Classification model. In this project gene descriptions and diseases associated with a particular are used to train the model and predict genetic diseases.
This will help in early treatment of the disease and thereby considerably improve the chances of curing a patient.
